# Quizzical App


## Description

Welcome to this project. The Quizzical App was made with JavaScript in the React-Framework. You can choose a difficulty and topic for the quiz questions on the first page. When started, the app pulls in five Questions from the "Open Trivia Database" API that can be answered in a multiple-choice on the second page. 

For now the layout is only suitable for middle to large sized screens. Maybe a responsive design for mobile will be added in the future.

Have fun testing your general knowledge.
